// Variable with explicit type
/// name2 is a variable with explicit type because we attribute it to a String type
var name2: String = "Vini"

// Variable with infered type
/// name3 is a variable with type inference
var name3 = "Vini"

// As a convention, Swift uses lowerCamelCase when naming variables
var firstName = "Vinícius"

// It's possible to use emojis
var 🐶 = "Linda"

// We can use , to concat strings in print function
print(🐶, " gosta muito de passaer")

// It's also possible to define multiple variables at once in the same line
var x = 12, y = "Oi", z = 3.3

// To create a constant, we use let instead of var
/// pi is a constant, so it's declarated with let instead of var
let pi = 3.14
